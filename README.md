# NMEA-Generator

This project is based on the vessel simulator from Tony Mattheys (https://sourceforge.net/projects/vesselsimulator/).

The NMEA Generator is simulating a GPS and a compass. It sends NMEA sentences to any application that connects via TCP/IP.

The NMEA Generator can be tested with OpenCPN.
